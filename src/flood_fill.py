    A class representing a Recursive Filling algorithm for filling an area with a color.

    The FloodFill class extends the Rasterization class and provides a recursive algorithm for filling an area
    with a specified color. It utilizes the Screen class for drawing and checking pixels.

    Attributes:
        point (tuple): The starting point for the filling operation.
        color (str): The color to fill the area with.
        edge_color (str): The color of the area's edge.
        screen (Screen): The screen object to perform the filling operation on.
